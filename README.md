# AIChat

This project is intended to become a full parity-complete replacement for the BYAI desktop application.

Current state of BYAI can be found at https://backyard.ai/

Right now, the code in TestRouterMVVM is the current state of the app, intended to potentially be called AIChat.

## Current Features
- Can import BYAF files
- Can see scenarios as "chats"
- Can add or remove scenarios

## Planned features
- Saving anything
- Actually talking with AI
- Incorporating Ollama backend

## Potential features
- Parties!
- Ability to import cards from online hubs
- Talk to cloud models!
- Multi-platform support

## Notes
This will take some time to develop.  I currently intend to try to match the feel of the BYAI desktop app, but I may decide to do more in the future.

## Special Thanks
- BYAI dev SPK (no longer works there), the main contributor to the BYAI desktop app    
- PacmanIncarnate, the main mod for a while on the discord, now a mod on the Dreamers hub Discord.  Thank you for always adding a good bit of humor.
  - Also the creator of a Vibe-coded project EllipsisLM

# Wait, so when is this releasing?
Probably some time in 2026.  BYAI may or may not be defunct by the time it happens.
